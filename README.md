#ShuttleDefense
==============

This was a project for our university (with Alexander Hirz). The goal was to create an own controller and programm a minigame for this controller. 
We created a retro ShuttleDefense minigame in Actionscript. To launch the minigame the controller must be connected. 
The Nocontroller folder contains the version without a controller.
